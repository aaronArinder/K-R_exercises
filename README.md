# K-R_exercises

These exercises come from the excellent book, "The C Programming Language", by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. To compile the programs, `gcc program_name` and then execute (when in the same directory) with `./a.out` (or, if you gave it a name with `-o`, `./specificed_name`. If you found these exercises while working through the book, let me know how you would improve them!

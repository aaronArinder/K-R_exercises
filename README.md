# K-R_exercises

These exercises come from an excellent book, "The C Programming Language", by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. To compile the programs, `gcc program_name` and then execute (when in the same directory) with `./a.out` (or, if you gave it a name with `-o`, `./specificed_name`. If you found these exercises while working through the book, let me know how you would improve them!

#### Exercises to return to
I wasn't interested in some exercises (notably the do-while control flow exercises, which felt like busy-work when I was already busy with work). They're listed below. Eventually I'll return to them and work them out properly. For those exercises, I used Tondo and Gimpel's _The C Answer Book_. It's quite good, and is best used as a way to check the sensibility of your own answer.
